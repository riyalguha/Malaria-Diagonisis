# Malaria-Diagonisis
A deep Learning model that can predict if the person has Malaria or not by the cell images of the person.

## Here in this model
Data augmentation has been done
All types cutmix,mixup,etc
## TensorBoard Intergration has been done to improve the performance of the model by hyperparameter tuning
## Weights & Biases or Wandb was used to do experiment tracking and to do hyperprameter tuning and for dataset and model versioning.
